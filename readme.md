# Organic 

A simple but elegant web page that I created from the design I found. Refer to source. 

## Methodologies and Technologies I Used

I used SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) as my CSS Preprocessor and ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) as my code architecture.

I also used BEM (Block Element Modifier) to add maintainability and reusability to the code.

For my technology, I used Gulp.js as my css compiler so that I don't need to use a separate compiler for my JS.

By the way, we usually don't upload dist folder but I did so I can host this to Github pages. :)
